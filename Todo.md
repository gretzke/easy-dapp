- tx tracker if sent from new-dapp url include address
- cookie consent https://github.com/maxandriani/ngx-google-analytics/issues/40
- shrink bundle size
- cancel edits
- local mode
- array list wallet icon misaligned

Optional:

- cheat codes for local networks (skip time, etc)
- auto parsing of function, input and output names from camelCase / snake_case?
- ENS integration?

fix:

- connected wallet => load dapp => disconnect wallet => dapp navigates to /
- go to app => connect with incorrect chain => should prompt to change chain
- ring arrows timepicker left right
- dynamic array input required after deleting item
- pending dot not aligned in tx tracker?
